# We should develop an application that will:
1) open a text file generated in excel
2) trm text
3) store text in list - each word has separate index
4) follow word pattern (entries repeat as they are stored in columns)
5) store key terms in a separate list - key terms are words that we are looking for ( mac address, usr name , password, email etc. )
6) compare terms with regex pattern // validate input
