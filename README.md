# We should develop an application that will:
1) open a text file generated in excel
2) trim text / data
3) store text in a list - each word has separate index
4) follow pattern (entries repeat as they are stored in columns i.e. every 4th entry  = usr name )
5) store key terms in a separate list - 'key terms' are words that we are looking for ( mac address, usr name , password, email etc. )
6) compare terms with regex pattern // validate input
